Monte‑Carlo simulation of GBM with wavelet construction

![Wavelet Monte‑Carlo GBM](outputFigures/waveletMonteCarlo.png)

```
The theoretical gain/loss from Black‑Scholes is -0.1926862567661427.
The experimental gain/loss from the Monte‑Carlo simulation is -0.16801284992930077.
The error between the Monte‑Carlo simulation with the wavelet construction and Black‑Scholes is 0.024673406836841938.
The error of the Monte‑Carlo simulation with the wavelet construction should converge in distribution to N(0.0, 0.0018316946276546895).
